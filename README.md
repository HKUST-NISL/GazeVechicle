- [x] Face detection and analysis
- [x] Eye gaze estimation
- [x] Mouth status estimation
- [x] Control signal rendering to the robot


### Preparation
- Download the eye gaze [models](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h23x33stlrhqvqq/AADn4iK7NMIc8bVnOkBpBBMSa?dl=0) and extract it to $ROOT_REPO


### Compile
```
cd $ROOT_REPO

<div align=center><img src="./asserts/bot_gazebo.png" width="800" height="450" ></div>

```
cd $ROOT_REPO
# show robot in gazebo
roslaunch mybot_gazebo mybot_world.launch
```

2. Show image obtained by the camera on the robot

<div align=center><img src="./asserts/bot_camera.png" width="800" height="450" ></div>

```
# show image from the robot camera
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/mybot/camera1/image_raw
